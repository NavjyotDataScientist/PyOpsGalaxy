        "        -   You don't have 2-Step Verification set up.\n",
        "        -   Your account is through work, school, or another organization.\n",
        "        -   You've turned on Advanced Protection.\n",
        "    -   At the bottom, click \"Select app\" and choose \"Mail\".\n",
        "    -   Click \"Select device\" and choose \"Other (Custom name)\". Type a name like \"Colab Email Sender\" and click \"Generate\".\n",
        "    -   Copy the 16-character password that appears in the yellow bar. This is your `password`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Replace Placeholders in the Code:**\n",
        "    -   Update `sender_email` with your actual email address.\n",
        "    -   Update `receiver_emails` with valid email addresses you want to send the test email to. For testing, you might use your own email address.\n",
        "    -   Replace `password` with the **App Password** you generated (or your regular password if your email provider doesn't require an App Password and you understand the security implications).\n",
        "    -   Customize the `body` content with your actual name, company, and contact details.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Run the Cell:**\n",
        "    -   Once you've updated the placeholders, run the code cell in your Colab notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "If successful, you should see `✅ Email sent successfully!` printed, and the recipient(s) will receive the email. If there's an error, the `❌ Error:` message will help you debug, often pointing to credential issues."
